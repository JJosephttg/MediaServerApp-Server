# MediaAppServer
​
# To Run The Server:

First, install mongodb (Dont change directory), and create the required C:/data/db directory

Then install nodejs and make sure you install all the modules by using cmd, and going into the directory of the server and typing "npm install"

Then install nodemon by typing "npm install -g nodemon" 

Finally create a Media directory in the root of a drive and a MediaIcons directory and run the runserver.ps1 with powershell and say n to manually configure the server settings. But before doing so, make sure there is a settings.txt in the same directory.... You can also manually edit the settings file and just swap the values.

Also if you edit the config, ONLY USE BACKSLASHES IN THE DIRECTORIES. (Will be fixed hopefully soon)

By the way, I recommend for using the server to use the latest branch: View-Files-Client
