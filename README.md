# MediaAppServer
Some modules are not in package.json. Just load the ones in the json, and any other module declarations in the app.js


# Run Server:

First, install mongodb, and create the required C:/data/db directory (something like that)

Then install nodejs and make sure you install all the modules

Finally create a Media directory in the root of a drive and a MediaIcons directory and change the directories accordingly in app.js and run the runserver.ps1 with powershell and say n to manually configure the server settings.


By the way, I recommend for using the server to use the latest branch: View-Files-Client
